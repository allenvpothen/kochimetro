	<h1>About Us</h1><br>
<p>The Kochi Metro is a rapid transit system serving the 
city of Kochi in Kerala, India. It was opened to the
 public within four years of starting construction, 
 making it one of the fastest completed metro projects
  in India. The Kochi metro project is the first
   metro in the country which connects rail, road and 
   water transport facilities. The first phase is 
   being set up at an estimated cost of â‚¹51.81 billion
  (US$650 million). In October 2017, Kochi Metro
  was named the Best Urban Mobility Project in India
   by the Urban Development Ministry, as part of the 
  Urban Mobility India (UMI) international 
  conference hosted by the ministry every year.
   The construction work was started in June 2013 and a 
  13.4 km (8.3 mi) section of the line from Aluva to 
   Palarivattom was opened to passengers on 17 
   June 2017 by Narendra Modi, the Prime Minister 
  of India.[16] A second 5 km (3.1 mi) section
    from Palarivattom to Maharaja's College metro 
    station was inaugurated on 3 October 2017.[16]
     Another 5.65 km (3.51 mi) section from 
   Maharaja's College Stadium to Thaikoodam was
         inaugurated on 3 September 2019 by Chief 
  Minister Pinarayi Vijayan and Union Minister 
         for Housing and Urban Affairs, Hardeep Singh 
         Puri.[17] Kochi metro also includes the
       technology for driverless trains and is 
       hoping to implement this in the near future.
